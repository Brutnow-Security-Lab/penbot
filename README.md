# Pentestool
We will create a simple tool called PenBot, which will have the following features:

Subdomain Enumeration (using Sublist3r or similar)
Basic Web Vulnerability Scanning (using requests or BeautifulSoup for simple checks like HTTP headers, SSL, etc.)
AI Integration: AI features like using pre-trained models to analyze vulnerabilities and prioritize them.
Automated Reporting (generate simple HTML or JSON reports)

  # Structure of the Python Tool

   Subdomain Enumeration: Use DNS resolution to find subdomains.
   Vulnerability Scanning: Basic vulnerability checks for things like outdated software or misconfigurations.
   Reporting: Generate a report for the user.

 # How to Run the Script

   Save the script as penbot.py.
   Run the script:

    bash
    python penbot.py
    
   Input the domain you want to test (e.g., example.com).
   The tool will enumerate subdomains, scan for vulnerabilities, and generate a report.

This tool provides a basic foundation for a penetration testing and bug bounty hunting, and it can be extended with more advanced features as needed in future versions.
